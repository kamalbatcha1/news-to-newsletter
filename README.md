# 📰 Automated News Intelligence Pipeline

An end-to-end Python-based news aggregation and processing pipeline that fetches real-time news from RSS feeds, classifies articles, ranks them based on relevance, and generates a structured newsletter output.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world **news intelligence system** inspired by platforms like **Google News** and **Flipboard**.

It builds an end-to-end data pipeline that:

- Ingests live RSS feeds
- Processes and classifies articles
- Applies relevance scoring
- Generates structured newsletters
- Displays insights via Streamlit dashboard

📌 Focus: Data Engineering + NLP + Ranking Systems + Visualization

## ⚙️ How It Works


1. RSS feeds are fetched using `feedparser`
2. Articles are extracted (title + link)
3. Articles are classified by category
4. Headlines are summarized (extractive method)
5. Relevance score is calculated using:
   - Category weight
   - Keyword matching
6. Articles are sorted by score
7. Output generated in:
   - CLI newsletter
   - Text file
   - Streamlit dashboard
